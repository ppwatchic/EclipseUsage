##Editing the code  
1. copy related  
1.1 `Ctrl + Alt + DOWN`: copy one line.   
1.2 `alt + DOWN`: move copied line downside.  

2. delete line: `ctrl + D`.   

3. jump to line mth: `ctrl + L`.  
   will pop up windows to key in line number.   
   
4. **Big Boss**: `ctrl + shift + L`brings up the hotkey helper.  

5. `ctrl + shift + o`: organize imports. 

6. `F3` opens the declaration. 
For example, I like to see the definition for `TrieNode`, `F3` gives great help.  

7. code auto-completion    
7.1 generate constructors by fields: 
`Shift + Alt + S` follows `O`.  
BTW, if we like to generate constructors by super class: 
`Shift + ALT + S` follows `C`.    
7.2 generate setter/getter by fields: 
`Shift + ALT + S` follows `R`.  

8. naviage in editor  
`HOME/END` moves to beginning/end of a line when cursor sitted.   
`Ctrl + HOME/END`moves to begnning/end of source file.
